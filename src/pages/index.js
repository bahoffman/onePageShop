      <h3>How to use</h3>
      <p>
        Wash face thoroughly with soap and water. Dry face well. Pump the bottle
        3 to 5 times until you have an appropriate amount of gel on your finger.
        Apply the gel to the skin on your face, neck, or other areas that are
        dry and rough. Gently massage when the gel becomes white (do not rub
        skin too hard). Rinse well after you see results. Use lotion or skin
        cream that you normally use. For best results, apply twice a week.
